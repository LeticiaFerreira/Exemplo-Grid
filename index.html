        <div>
            Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come my baby
We might took the long way
We knew we'd get there someday

They said: I bet they'll never make it
But just look at us holding on
We're still together, still going strong

You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
You're still the one that I love
The only one that I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight

Ain't nothing better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missing

They said: I bet they'll never make it
But just look at us holding on
We're still together, still going strong
